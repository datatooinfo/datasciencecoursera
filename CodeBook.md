X_test     Input file X_test.txt. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

X_train    Input file X_train.txt. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Features   Input file features.txt. List of features normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

SubjectTest  Input file subject_test.txt. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

SubjectTrain Input file subject_train.txt. Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

spFeatures  Created file. Subset of features.txt maintaining variable names as a vector.

names  Process of converting variable names for files X_test and X_train using the vector created in spFeatures. The variable name for SubjectTest and SubjectTrain are converted to "Subject”.
 
X_test_combine  Created file. Combines SubjectTest and X_test into one data set.

X_train_combine Created file. Combines SujectTrain and X_train into one data set.

mergeData Created file. Merges X_test_combine and X_train_combine into one data set.

mean_colname Created file. A group of column numbers with “mean” in the variable name used to subset mergeData and calculate the mean for those columns only.

SD_colname Created file. A group of column numbers with “std” in the variable name used to subset mergeData and calculate the standard deviation for those columns only.

AVE_colname Created file. A group of all variables used to calculate the mean for all columns.

projectmean  Created file. Output containing the mean values for all variables with “mean” in the variable name.

projectSD Created file. Output containing the standard deviations for all variables with “std” in the variable name.

projectAVE Created file. Output containing the mean for all variables.
